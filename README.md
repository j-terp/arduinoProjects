# Arduino Projects

This is a repository for several smaller projects using an Arduino UNO and some electrical components. To run any of the programs, copy over the `main.cpp` into `.\launch\src\`, where PlatformIO will be able to run it with `.\launch\` as it's directory.

The projects all date from 4th December 2020.

## Door Alarm

## Music Box
Plays ~~music~~ some notes with a buzzer and an arduino.

## Voltage Measurement
